Hi Comunix :)

I built this game in 3 days and I hope you like it.

In the project I included 2 of the bonus tasks.
1. SFX
2. 4 Levels in increasing difficulty.
(And made some basic graphics for some items)

SFX - In my previous project JEFF-16 I integrated sound effect and it made the game
much more immersive and interesting for me. I believe that when a player does a good or bad thing
he or she should be instantly rewarded and made aware of what's happening
and sometimes visuals are not enough, that's where sounds make a big difference.

Levels - 1 level gameplay? Those are more suitable for endless runners...
In PANG, or Bubble Trouble as I know it, there's an important "Flow State" felt thoughout the
levels, being able to clear a set of balls from the stage will just make you want to pop some more!
So I decided to give the player what he or she wants, even if it's just a demo.

I went with the two mentioned above because they were the most relevant
for representing a prototype of a game in the best way in my opinion. 
Sounds + Flow State = A FUN DEMO

Have Fun and... Hire me :)
